  - GTZAN Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification
  - FMA Small Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/fma-free-music-archive-small-medium

GTZAN Dataset
1. Download the GTZAN dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification 
2. Upload it into your drive. (Create a folder and upload the folder downloaded here. It should have the folder name "Data" which contains images_original, genres_original, features_3_sec.csv and features_30s.csv)
3. Use the correct link to your drive in the required cells.
   
FMA Dataset
1. Original FMA Dataset GitHub repository - https://github.com/mdeff/fma. Downloading the data from the original repo and loading it into the drive takes a long time and space since it is 7.2 GB, so instead we are using the FMA Small from Kaggle using Kaggle API
FMA Kaggle Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imsparsh/fma-free-music-archive-small-medium
2. Download your Kaggle API file kaggle.json and upload into the colab by running the cells in the notebook. This is needed to download the dataset into the notebook.
